# solar-system-maker
Repository for my A Level Computer Science coursework of which I plan to continue development after my A Levels. SolarSystemMaker is a minimalistic, educational 2D solar system simulation complete with user accounts and saved solar systems.

# Installation
I'm very new to distributing stuff so until I can figure out setup files and distutils and all that, installation will have to be very manual. Apologies! 

Dependencies:
- Pygame
- cx_Oracle

Oracle Instant Client
- You will need to download and unzip the Oracle Instant Client from https://www.oracle.com/uk/database/technologies/instant-client/microsoft-windows-32-downloads.html. This allows the application to connect to the SolarSystemMaker database. 
- Open the folder and find the instant client folder within it. Put this folder in the same directory as the SolarSystemMaker files. To start SolarSystemMaker, run main.py.

This is a test change
